# Interim-Project-Proposal-AdventureWorks2019

Interim Project Overview 

Data Analyst Program - Interim Project 
Project Description
The AdventureWorks demo database serves as a great platform to practise SQL and data analytics skills. With this project, participants will be given the opportunity to boast the SQL, Python and data analytics skills that they have learned in the Data Analytics program so far.
Learning Objectives
Utilise SQL, Python, and data analytics skills to uncover key learnings from a sample dataset.
Create a presentation deck.
Deliver a group presentation, clearly communicating analytical results.

Interim Project: 12 hours working sessions + 15 minute presentation

Team Structure
A group of 3-5 members 

Project Instructions and Deliverables
You will work in your groups to answer a set of questions using the AdventureWorks dataset, a demo dataset maintained by Microsoft. You will use your combined knowledge of SQL, Python, and data analytics to investigate the dataset and answer these questions: 

What are the regional sales in the best performing country?
What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?
What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?
What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title (PersonType)?
What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?
What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?

You will answer these questions in a concise, informative, and accurately worded PowerPoint presentation that includes charts to support your findings.

When complete, you will need to submit your groupsâ€™ full project portfolio to your instructor for a group technical score. This portfolio should include the following deliverables:
A simple summary of open-source libraries comparison linked to project
A list of ideas generated, consisting of conceptual sketches, function, and key components
A simple written overview describing the database schema, table structure, and entity-relationship model
The source code for your solutions to finish this task 
Final report that provides accurate answers to the questions, with charts (flexible format; can be a PowerPoint, document, etc.) 

The class will have a total of twelve hours for groups to complete project tasks and deliverables; this includes time to research the presentation. Each group will deliver a 15 minute presentation using their final report, followed by 5-10 minutes of Q&A. Time is allocated for final presentation prep and rehearsal before the actual presentation. 

To get started: Access the AdventureWorks demo dataset; communicate with your instructor if you need assistance.

Technical Assessment:
A technical score will be given to each group based on their final report, presentation, and additional deliverables completed. 
This score will be determined by the instructor using the Interim Project Rubric.

BSM Assessment:
After the project, participants will complete the BSM Self-Assessment Form and the BSM Peer-Assessment Form.
Participants can use the BSM Evaluation Criteria as a guiding tool to complete the BSM Assessment Forms.
